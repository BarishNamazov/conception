# Concept-Driven Backend framework

## Inspiration

Didn't like the way I coded this project: [Fritter](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/fritter).

## Goals

Make development based on concepts as taught in [6.1040](https://61040-fa22.github.io/schedule) easy.

## Philosophy

For now, see [thoughts](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/conception/blob/main/thoughts.md), but might add to here more later.

## TODOS

- [x] Basic base for defining concepts and routers.

- [x] Make very simple Fritter with Freet and User concepts.

- [x] More examples of concepts under `src/concepts/`, making a simple app.

  - User, Freet, Friend -- fully modular!

- [x] Make methods work with direct method references rather than string names.

- [x] Make actions work with the contents of request directly rather than deal with `req` and `res`.

- [ ] Optional: Implement singleton concept base (i.e., easy user has only one of that object).

- [ ] Unit tests? Need to figure out how to set up Mongo or in-memory mock for that.

- [ ] Simple frontend to test backend manually (or just Postman?).

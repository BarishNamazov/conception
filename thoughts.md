Thoughts during the development, mainly self-dialogue

---

### Concern

I have pre-defined methods like `defineCreateAction`. Let's say we want to use this for `Freet` concept. Now the API would require the client to send `author` in the request body so this can work. Technically, this is not required: the logged in user is already stored in session. Is this good or bad?

### Thoughts

Let's see pros and cons.

- Pro: This actually could be a feature in an app where one can make posts on behalf of others (then you just need to validate this process).
- Con: Client is more verbose by sending info that's already known.
- Pro: Client is more verbose?
  - Reading code might be easier üßê

### Decision

Keep the feature, con is not strong enough.

### Concern

Let's say we implement singleton concepts with defintion of "one instance per user." Notice that the "user" part is arbitrary -- why not "one instance per C" where C any concept? This brings us question: is `Upvote` concept a non-singleton concept or a `SingletonConcept<Freet>`?

Who "owns" the upvote -- is it the freet or the user?

### Thoughts

Not sure yet.

### Decision

Not sure yet.

### Concern

MongoDB functions silently fail when passing in `string` rather than `ObjectId`.

### Thoughts

Need to define a convention or allow both but cast? Is it even good idea to go with `_id` naming?

### Decision

Not sure yet.

### Concern

`session` as an express param passed as whole is confusing.

### Thoughts

Make it a concept (Geoffrey).

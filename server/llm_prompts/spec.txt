I need a spec that explains my document and concept interfaces very briefly (only public methods). For example, it might look like this for a given code:

UserDoc = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

UserConcept = {
  async create: (username: string, password: string) => {msg: string, user: UserDoc}; // throws error if username already exists
  async getUser: (_id: ObjectId) => UserDoc; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async getUserByUsername: (username: string) => UserDoc; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async idsToUsernames: (ids: ObjectId[]) => string[]; // replaces non-existent user with "DELETED" username
  async authenticate: (username: string, password: string) => {msg: string, _id: ObjectId}; // throws error if can't authenticate
  async updatePassword: (_id: ObjectId, password: string) => {msg: string, user: UserDoc}; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async delete: (_id: ObjectId) => {msg: string}; // throws error if user doesn't exist
}

Generate a similar spec for this code that looks exactly like above. Remember, only public methods. Don't reply with any other message, just the spec as in the example.
